            No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It
            belongs to everyone. Do not believe the claims of businesses who
            offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras
            website. Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell
            their products or services to those who do not know better. Products
            or websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each
            individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise.
            In some parts of the country, official organizations control their
            Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.

            The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day
            (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is
            on a different day each year. Fat Tuesday changes every year because
            Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat Tuesday is
            always the day before Ash Wednesday. Most visitors plan to arrive no
            later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash
            Wednesday. Check out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will
            fall through the next few years

            almost hot. Sometimes it will change from one extreme to the other
            during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a
            chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon. Since you will be
            spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that
            can get somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain.
            If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely want to bring a
            raincoat!

            The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New
            Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is the weekend when Bacchus and
            Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the
            streets of New Orleans. The streets are packed all day Saturday and
            Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer than a weekend,
            Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days to
            experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that
            Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras festival goes on all day. On
            Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing all of the
            costumes and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.

            By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a
            family celebration. Those of us who grew up in New Orleans feel
            guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to
            every parade because we used to use "taking the children" as our
            excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of the
            stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys, stuffed animals,
            beads, and more. The only place you should avoid with kids is the
            French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass anyway). We
            recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue
            near Napoleon since parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of
            the route. The Garden District portion of St. Charles is a family
            area where you will see many families staking out their parade
            watching position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun
            under the beautiful oak trees. You don't have to worry about the
            streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras. You
            may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in
            suburban areas like Metairie, which is only 10 minutes away from New
            Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi Gras
            weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras day. Kids
            love it!

            The Mardi Gras day routes are not published anywhere, but they
            happen in and around their inner-city neighborhoods. Some sources

            the Krewe of Zulu passes by. Other tribes meet at the corner of
            Claiborne and Orleans following the Zulu parade. The New Orleans
            Mardi Gras Indian Council always has their Indian Sunday on the
            third Sunday of March, around St. Joseph's Day. Their festivities
            begin at Noon in A. L. Davis Park (at Washington & LaSalle Streets)
            where the Mardi Gras Indians once again dress in their feathers and
            suits, and take to the streets to meet other "gangs." the Tambourine
            and Fan organizations traditionally hold their "Super Sunday" parade
            on the Sunday closest to St. Joseph's Day, with the event beginning
            at Bayou St. John. In recent years, there has been yet a third Super
            Sunday called Big Sunday that falls in April during the open weekend
            between French Quarter Festival and Jazz Fest. No specific details
            are available on these events at this time.

            During Mardi Gras parades, seats aren’t a necessity. Most people at
            the parades will be standing or even jumping for throws—and in
            between parades, people are walking around and popping into local
            restaurants for a bite. However, we recommend Grandstands for people
            who may have trouble standing or walking for longer than an hour at
            a time.

            There is not a single official Mardi Gras theme since there is no
            single organization in charge of Mardi Gras. Each parade krewe
            decides on its own theme each year, which is often kept secret until
            the parade. Their costumes, floats, some of their throws, and their
            "official" Mardi Gras poster (if they have one) reflect this theme.
            For example, after 9/11, patriotic themes were popular. Most of the
            krewes are named after figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian
            mythology, but some are named after the neighborhood where they
            parade.

            There is a city ordinance in Orleans Parish that prohibits Mardi
            Gras from being commercialized, i.e., no advertising is allowed on
            floats or can be thrown from floats. In addition, some of the Mardi
            Gras organizations have events outside of their actual parade where
            sponsors can participate. These include Zulu’s Lundi Gras Festival,
            Endymion’s big bash before their parade, Metairie’s “Family Gras”,
            and the ticketed extravaganzas held after some of our parades (such
