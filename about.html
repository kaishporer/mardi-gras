            <p>
              The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana,
              including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated
              for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day
              before Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian
              tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
              permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and
              most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
              Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New
              Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls
              (some of them masquerade balls). The parades in New Orleans are
              organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same
              parade schedule and route each year. The earliest-established
              krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
              Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super
              krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events, such
              as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming
              celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of
              Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings),
              as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Clubâ€”a predominantly
              African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws
              into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful
              plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon
              Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same
              parade schedule and route each year. While many tourists center
              their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades
              originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route
              along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of
              the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du
              Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the Faubourg
              Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras
              day. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of
              the Courts" between Rex and Comus

            <h3 class="purple">The history of the festival</h3>
            <p>
              The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was
              at the mouth of the Mississippi River in what is now lower
              Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville,
              Bienville, and their men celebrated it as part of an observance of
              Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the
              festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by
              Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and
              costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt | A Company Man -
              The Book An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls
              was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in the
              streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited
              by law, and were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were
              lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de
              Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent, raised
              money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration. In 1856 21
              businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to
              organize a secret society to observe Mardi Gras with a formal
              parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the
              Mystick Krewe of Comus. According to one historian, "Comus was
              aggressively English in its celebration of what New Orleans had
              always considered a French festival. It is hard to think of a
              clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the holiday
              had passed from French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a
              certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its
              Creoles. To a certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the
              Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of how
              their business prowess helped them construct a more elaborate
              version than was traditional. The lead in organized Carnival
              passed from Creole to American just as political and economic
              power did over the course of the nineteenth century. The spectacle
              of Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms
              to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms and on the streets,
              represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely
              Creole nor entirely American.

            <p>
              The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans
              are purple, green, and gold. The colors were first specified in
              proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their
              inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in
              banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors
              were chosen; some accounts suggest that they were initially
              selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true
              symbolism. Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History
              of the Rex Organization, presented a theory that the colors were
              based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic
              tincture, and Rex's goal may have been to create a tricolor to
              represent their "kingdom". Purple was widely associated with
              royalty, while white was already heavily used on other national
              flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in
              green, gold and purple in that order complies with the rule of
              tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be
              placed on or next to other colors, and that colors cannot be
              placed on or next to other colors. Following a color-themed Rex
              parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and gold-colored
              floats themed around the concepts, the Rex organization
              retroactively declared that the three colors in that order
              symbolized justice, power, and faith. The traditional colors are
              commonly addressed as purple, green, and gold, in that orderâ€”even
              though this order technically violates the rule of tincture.

            <p>
              Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman
              to hold the position in the city's history. Once in office, she
              established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of
              creating a strategic plan to address families in crisis in the
              city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council,
              tasked with finding solutions to violent crime. Starting with a
              push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city
              use, Cantrell has focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve
              city infrastructure, public transportation, public parks, and
              green spaces. As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City
              of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid manufacturers
              and distributors. During the 2019 session of the Louisiana
              Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share Agreement with
              Governor John Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials.
              The agreement secured $50 million in upfront funding for the
              city's infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual
              recurring revenue for the city. Following the approval of the Fair
              Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of the 4 proposals
              Mayor Cantrell and the City Council put on the ballot in the 2019
              general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale and a
              tax on short-term rental properties, as well the establishment of
              a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.
